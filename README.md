# Welcome to zUMIs :wrench: :red_car::dash: :wrench:

## Quickstart
Nobody likes reading long README files so here is how you get going:
Fetch zUMIs by cloning the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs.git
```
Start anaylysing your data:
```
zUMIs/zUMIs.sh -c -y my_config.yaml
```
zUMIs now comes with its own [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) environment, so you do not need to deal with dependencies or installations (use the -c flag to use conda).
If you wish to use your own dependencies, head to the [zUMIs wiki](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs/wiki/Installation#dependencies) to see what is required.
